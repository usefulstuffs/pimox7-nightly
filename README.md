Prechecks

1. Pre-installed Debian __Bullseye__ based  ___64-bit___ OS (not 32bit)
2. In /etc/network/interfaces, give the Pi a static IP address. You cannot use dhcp.
3. In /etc/network/interfaces, remove any IPv6 addresses.
4. In /etc/hostname, make sure the Pi has a name.
5. In /etc/hosts, make sure this hostname corresponds to the static IP you previous set.
6. Make sure the kernel-headers are installed.

Installation
1. echo "deb http://vichingo455.ddns.net/pimox/pimox7/debian dev/" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pimox.list
2. curl http://vichingo455.ddns.net/pimox/pimox7/debian/pimox7.gpg |  apt-key add -
3. apt update
4. apt install proxmox-ve (use a local attatched console! Network connections will be lost/reset during installation progress)

Notes
---
1. This repo just contains the precompiled debian packages. The original Proxmox sources can be found at https://git.proxmox.com
2. The (very minimally) patched sources to rebuild this can be found at https://github.com/pimox
